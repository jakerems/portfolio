  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>Hello. I am a Jacob Rems UX/UI Designer based in the San Francisco Bay Area.
I am driven by the ritual and craft of good design, technology, and user research. These
tools help strategically create the ultimate user experience. I know the ins and outs of
a plethora of design tools including Sketch, Invision, Adobe Photoshop, Figma, Invision
Studio, Illustrator, Principle, Flinto, Zeplin, and Adobe XD. I used Adobe Photoshop, and
Illustrator for a good amount of my work, I feel most comfortable using products that
help craft good design.
When It comes to creating an art piece, the first step in my process is to brain
storm. Notes, storyboards, and lists of terms pertaining to the topic of my product’s
concept are first collected. Once I have a plethora of ideas, I begin the funneling
process, topics and ideas that don’t successfully communicate the overall point are
thrown out, those that do are further expanded on. After I have a strong group of
concepts, I begin wire framing. I create skeletal blueprints for my future product,
Shaping the base structure of what is to come. A content map is made to explore the
possible routes that can be explored via ideas. Finally, I begin to work, a culmination of
all my ideas and work flows begin to come together in an artistic catharsis, finally
created the final product. Once finished, I touch up small errors, spell check, and refine
my work of art.
